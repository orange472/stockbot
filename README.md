# Stock Trading with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This repository contains an ongoing project focused on using reinforcement learning to make stock trading decisions. The goal is to create an intelligent trading agent that predicts whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock based on technical indicators. Please note that this project in still in development

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Model:** The core of the project is a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) that leverages techniques such as a prioritized replay buffer and double-Q learning.

- **OpenAI Gym Environment:** An environment has been implemented following OpenAI gym guidelines, enabling the model to interact with a simulated stock market. This facilitates training and evaluation of the reinforcement learning agent in a controlled environment.

## Current Status

This project is still in development and is not ready for production use. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we work towards refining the model's performance and robustness.

## Usage

As of now, the model is not ready for practical use, and further development is required. However, feel free to explore the code, experiment with the OpenAI gym environment, and contribute to the project's growth.
